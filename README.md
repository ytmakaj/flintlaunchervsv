## What is FlintLauncher?

FlintLauncher is a free, open-source Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android, forked from [ZalithLauncher](https://github.com/ZalithLauncher/ZalithLauncher). Built with one goal: **make Minecraft Java accessible to every Android user**, especially those on low-end or older devices that other launchers ignore.

## Features

### Performance
- **Auto RAM profiling** — detects your device's memory and sets safe JVM limits automatically
- **GPU-based renderer switching** — picks the best renderer for your GPU (GL4ES, Zink, VirGL)
- **Optimized JVM arguments** — tuned garbage collection and heap settings for low-end hardware
- **CPU thread control** — prevents the JVM from choking slower processors

### Compatibility
- Supports **Android 8.0+** (API 26+)
- **ARM32 and ARM64** device support
- Works with **Mali, Adreno, PowerVR, and Dimensity** GPUs
- Compatible with **Forge, Fabric, Quilt, and NeoForge**

### 🌐 Open Source
- Fully open source under **GPL-3.0**
- Community-driven development
- Clean, documented codebase
- Easy to fork and contribute to
